# Browser-tracker
The objective of this project is to develop a streamlined web browser 
history tracker employing a linked implementation of stacks for effective 
management of the user's browsing history. 
The program provides users with the capability to navigate
 both backward and forward through their browsing history.

 The program starts by reads from initial URLs from a file located at C:\Data\BrowserHistory.txt. Example URLs:

www.unisa.ac.za

www.sars.gov.za

www.lions.com
